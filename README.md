This is a command-line tool that helps you manage sales processes. It is a very basic application, without much functionality.

The app is built to test out a tool that splits up monolithic software to predict good microservice boundaries. 


Use the following command to run the application:

`python -m salie.main`

This means that you have to run it as a module, and not as a Python script.
