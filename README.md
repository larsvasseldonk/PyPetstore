# SALIE

Salie is a very basic command-line tool written in Python to manage sales processes. The app is mainly build as a ground truth to test a tool that splits monolithic software into microservices. However, the application can be used for other purposes too. Feel free to use it as a start for your own project.

## Getting started
Use the following command to run the application:

`python -m salie.main`

This means that you have to run the app as a module, and not as a Python script.
